A lightweight command-and-control (C2) framework that uses GitHub Issues for communication between the operator and the agent.

### Why??
Just cause I can

# What is this project?

This is a pet project I've been working on for a while now, just about time I brought it to GitHub.

- Uses GitHub Issues as a C2 communication channel
- Real-time command execution and response retrieval  
- Manual terminal clearing with a unique command  

# Further Developments
